# PROJECT_STATE — Driving Log Pro

শেষ যাচাই: 2026-11-05 · ভিত্তি: `main` (Full-Time data protection update)

## কাজের নিয়ম
- মালিককে উত্তর দিন বাংলায় এবং খুব সংক্ষেপে: কাজ শেষ হলে শুধু "হয়ে গেছে" + লিংক; না হলে অল্প কথায় কারণ।
- কাজ শুরুর আগে বর্তমান `main` এবং এই ফাইল পড়ুন।
- Claude/ChatGPT—কেউই পুরোনো divergent branch-এ push বা merge করবেন না। প্রতিটি নতুন কাজ `main` থেকে নতুন branch-এ শুরু করুন।
- প্রতিটি app asset পরিবর্তনের পর `sw.js` cache version বাড়ান।
- Public repository-তে কখনো student data, CSV/JSON backup, token বা private data commit করবেন না।
- Source update, Pages deployment success এবং real iPhone runtime test—তিনটি আলাদা verification status হিসেবে রিপোর্ট করুন।

## Architecture
- Vanilla JavaScript PWA; build step নেই; GitHub Pages: `main`, root.
- Main files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`, `reports-dashboard.js` (Reports dashboard, loaded after app.js), `islamic-content.js` (dua/tasbih text only) + `islamic.js` (Islamic tab), `prayer-times.js`, `full-time-students.js`, `sw.js`, `manifest.webmanifest`.
- Tabs: Overview, Calendar, Log, Students, Reports, Islamic.
- Main data localStorage key: `driving-log-pro-v1` (`entries`, `students`, packages, prayer/work settings).
- Full-Time historical register key: `driving-log-pro-full-time-v1`; records keyed by `legacy_student_id`, isolated from normal lesson accounting.
- Main app exposes a narrow `window.DrivingLogFullTime` bridge (getAll/replace/clear) so full-time data can participate in backup/sync without mixing into lesson accounting.
- Cloud sync stores `driving-log.json` in the user's own private GitHub data repository; token remains in that browser's localStorage.
- Current service-worker cache: `nahians-schedule-cache-v48`.
- App footer version: `v1.20`. CSS comments such as v1.26 may refer to feature revision, not app release.

## Business rules
- Default lesson rate €20/hour.
- Income = lesson value; profit = income minus expenses; expenses are not income.
- Timer target: 55 minutes; completed timer lesson receives 1 hour business credit, actual time is stored separately.
- Full-Time register is historical only and must not affect current lessons, packages, revenue or reports.
- Full-Time records use unique `legacy_student_id`; do not merge by name.

## Data protection — current implementation
- JSON export now includes `fullTime` alongside main app state.
- JSON restore validates optional `fullTime` records and restores them when present.
- Legacy backups without `fullTime` preserve the device's existing Full-Time register; they do not silently erase it.
- Automatic safety copies use the same combined snapshot.
- Cloud snapshot, three-way merge and restore include Full-Time records, using `legacy_student_id` as the merge key.
- Delete All explicitly clears the local Full-Time register as well as main app data; cloud copy remains untouched after this device disconnects.
- Full-Time CSV export/import remains available as an additional independent safety option.
- Public app repo contains code only; actual records and token must remain outside this repo.

## Current features
Lesson/expense log, student CRM, packages/prepaid accounting, reports, CSV import/export, JSON backup/restore, safety copies, optional private GitHub cloud sync, calendar, 55-minute timer, Bengali voice announcements (device voice availability dependent), travel dua audio, and separate Full-Time Students historical register.

## Known limitations / verification still needed
1. Real iPhone Safari and Home Screen PWA testing is still required for timer audio, Bengali voice availability, screen wake, update prompt, clipboard/native paste and offline startup.
2. Cloud sync is optional and uses the user's private GitHub repository/token; it is not a managed database or guaranteed real-time service.
3. Cloud sync should be enabled only after a fresh JSON backup and confirmation that the chosen private data repository is private and token scope is limited.
4. Script order is verified in `index.html`: `prayer-times.js`, then `full-time-students.js`, then `app.js`. The Full-Time bridge is therefore defined before the main app initializes and calls `load()` / initial sync.
5. Test upgrade/restore scenarios using: current backup with Full-Time rows, legacy backup without Full-Time rows, empty Full-Time list, and simultaneous edits/deletions on two devices.
6. Never claim iPhone runtime verified solely from successful GitHub Pages deployment.

## Master scope vs current app (owner's handover document, checked 2026-11-06)
The owner's "Master Project Handover" lists the full business scope. It is a requirements list, not a description of the app. Source code on `main` (v1.20) was checked against it; the app is **not** feature-complete and real iPhone testing is still pending (see Known limitations).

| Area | Status in code |
|---|---|
| Students: name, contact, lesson history, completed lessons, payment history | Done |
| Remaining lessons | Done through packages/courses (hours left, paid, due) |
| Lesson scheduling, duration, calendar, completed lessons | Done |
| Payments, financial records, business reports, analytics | Done |
| Search | Done (Log and Students) |
| Cloud sync, backup, offline, data export | Done (private GitHub repo sync, JSON/CSV, safety copies, PWA) |
| Cancelled / missed lessons | Partial: lessons can be "Marked not completed" (count in Attendance); no reason or cancellation history |
| Notifications | Partial: timer and voice announcements only; no push notifications |
| Multilingual | Partial: English UI with Bangla content and messages; no language switch |
| Driving progress | Partial: hours and attendance only; no skills/progress record |
| Instructor management | Not built |
| Vehicle management | Not built |
| Driving examination tracking | Not built |
| Personal documents and document expiry | Not built (sensitive data: device and private sync only, never the public repo) |
| Secure authentication, access control | Not built (single-user app, no login) |
| Error monitoring | Not built |
| GDPR compliance | Not formally addressed; data stays on the owner's devices and private data repo |

Owner's development rules (same intent as the rules above): never delete working features without permission; no unnecessary redesign; keep the current UI/UX; inspect code before changing it; avoid unnecessary data migrations; protect student and business records; test before completion; stay backward compatible with existing data and backups; keep the app stable and secure; document every significant change here; finish with a GitHub commit/PR. Never assume a listed feature exists: check the source.

Suggested next features (owner to choose): exam tracking and document expiry first, then cancellation history.

## Branch hygiene
- `claude/intelligent-gates-shiyps` is permanently divergent (32 commits behind main, one unique commit); do not push, merge or force-push it.
- Previous feature branches may contain work already merged by PR; inspect diffs before reusing.
- Current main is the source of truth.

## Recent work
- Student form cleanup: removed optional Email, Address and Notes inputs from Add/Edit Student; existing stored values are preserved for backward compatibility and are not deleted. Contact details remain Name, Phone and WhatsApp; hourly rate remains editable.
- Reports: detailed charts, health, financial calendar, student payments and comparisons are inside a collapsible "Financial Reports" section (collapsed by default, `#finToggle`/`#finBody`); the hero KPIs, mini stats and insights stay visible. Only the layout changed; no calculation touched.
- Islamic Companion (6th tab, `islamic-content.js` + `islamic.js`): dua library with 5 categories, detail page (Arabic RTL, Bengali pronunciation, Bengali meaning, English, reference, text size, reading mode), favourites, Tasbih counter (separate counts and targets per dhikr). Data in `state.islamic` = {v,fav,tasbih,tz} — included in snapshot/JSON backup, restore (older backups keep this device's Islamic data) and cloud three-way merge. Reading prefs per device in `DB_KEY+"-islamic-prefs"`. One audio element (#duaAudio) is shared with the Overview Travel Dua player. Religious text status: prepared from well-known references, review by owner/scholar still pending; recordings: vehicle dua (travel-dua.mp3), Ayatul Kursi (ayatul-kursi.mp3, 49 s) and the Three Quls (three-quls.mp3, 60 s) — both cut from one owner-supplied video (TikTok @fro6w, source/licence not confirmed). Surah Al-Kahf 18:1–10 card with the owner's file surah-al-kahf-1-10-alafasy.mp3 (127 s, 192 kbps, unchanged; reciter as named by the owner). The other 7 duas use recordings from Hisnul Muslim (hisnmuslim.com/audio/ar/16, 207, 216, 217, 248, 53.mp3) and EveryAyah (Alafasy 017080.mp3), kept unchanged; licence not confirmed. Downloading them needs the session environment `driving-log-pro` (allows hisnmuslim.com, everyayah.com). The Overview player always switches the shared audio back to travel-dua.mp3.
- Reports dashboard (Phase 4, `reports-dashboard.js`): hero KPIs with count-up (Revenue earned, Expenses, Net, Collected, Outstanding), mini stats, factual insights vs the previous period ("so far" for the running period), revenue/expense chart with 6M/12M/All, expense donut (Fuel, Maintenance=Repair, Insurance, Other incl. refunds), 8-week activity, Business health (profit margin, collection ratio, revenue trend, schedule utilisation from working hours — "Insufficient data" when the inputs are missing), monthly financial calendar with day details, CSV/Share/Print and extra PDF section. Definitions are written at the top of `reports-dashboard.js`. The Calendar tab is unchanged.
- Overview (Phase 3): the lesson timer card now sits on Overview under the Next lesson card (same timer logic, same ids; still stops at 55 min with 1 h credit); other tabs show a small "⏱ … left" pill that opens Overview. Below Next Day: Voice announcements (on/off per device in `DB_KEY+"-voice"`, Test voice, voice status) and a Travel Dua player using the local `travel-dua.mp3` (12 s recitation of 43:13–14 supplied by the owner; cached by the service worker, range requests answered from cache for offline playback). Only one audio plays at a time; a voice announcement pauses audio. The pre-timer Travel Dua popup (full dua, remote Hisnul Muslim audio) is unchanged.
- Log (Phase 2): the floating ＋ button is removed; Log's button is "＋ Add expense" (record dialog without the Lesson type). Lessons are created from the Calendar (＋ in Calendar, tapping a day/slot) and from the student profile/quick booking. Log summary: lessons done today, hours, lesson value, collected, outstanding, expenses.
- Profile cleanup (Phase 1 of the master plan): profile tabs are Overview, Completed, Packages, Attendance. Overview shows only name + WhatsApp, the next 3 upcoming lessons and read-only notes (notes are edited in Edit student). Course payment history + Total paid moved under Packages. Lessons are marked paid with "Mark paid" in Completed. Contact fields are still stored.
- Decision (owner): the timer keeps the current rule — it stops at 55 minutes and credits 1 hour.
- Course payments (branch `claude/course-payments`): packages can hold `payments:[{id,date,amount}]` (partial advance payments; Due = price − paid). Old packages without `payments` keep the old Paid/Unpaid meaning. New package dialog: "Paid now (€)" and optional "Count earlier lessons" — *Hours only* stores `p.prior` (lesson ids; those lessons keep their own money, course rate = price ÷ remaining hours) or *Hours and money* links them with `e.pkg` and clears `e.paid`.
- Student profile: "🎓 Start full course" (shown when no course is running) opens the same package dialog pre-filled (17 h, rate × 17, earlier lessons as hours only). A course card at the top of the profile shows hours done/left, paid/due and ＋ Add payment.
- PR #19: premium responsive Log screen with live KPIs and sorting.
- PR #17: clipboard paste button implementation; later the user requested removing custom Paste buttons, and the related buttons/logic were removed from main.
- Latest data-protection update: Full-Time historical register now participates in JSON backup/restore, cloud sync three-way merge, and Delete All. README updated; footer version v1.20; service-worker cache v36.

## Verification record — 2026-11-05
- Source reviewed on `main`: Full-Time bridge, JSON backup/restore validation, combined safety snapshot, Cloud Sync merge key, Delete All behavior, timer 50/55-minute announcements, service-worker registration and cache asset list.
- `index.html` script order confirmed: `prayer-times.js` → `full-time-students.js` → `app.js`.
- GitHub Pages workflow run #68 for commit `5b8db6f0a6586951fdfa8b8fb094cbaea0df477e`: build, artifact upload and deploy jobs all succeeded.
- This is source review plus Pages deployment verification, not a browser/device end-to-end test. No claim of JavaScript runtime, iPhone audio, offline, or two-device sync verification is made.

## Handover
- This audit is being prepared on `maintenance/source-audit-2026-11-05`; merge only after reviewing the resulting pull request.
- No student data or tokens were accessed or changed during source maintenance.
- Remaining acceptance tests require a browser/device with the app's local data and, for Cloud Sync, the user's separately configured private repository.
